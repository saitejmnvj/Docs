Docker Docs

docker login <regisry name>
it will prompt for username and password

docker pull image name
docker build -t filname . <imagename> build args#Review this command
Having .docker_ignore is a good practice, so that we dont push unnecessary files with Image,
which will add upto the image size which is a big no-no
